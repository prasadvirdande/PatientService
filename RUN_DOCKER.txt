# How to Build and Run PatientService with Docker

1. Build the JAR file in your project directory. This will generate the JAR file at target/PatientService-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar.

2. Build the Docker image in the same directory as your Dockerfile. This will create a Docker image named patientservice.

3. Run the Docker container. This maps port 8080 of the container to port 8080 on your host machine.

4. Access your application by opening your browser and going to http://localhost:8080. Your Spring Boot application should now be running and accessible.

Notes:
- If you make changes to your code, rebuild the JAR and Docker image before running again.
- The src directory is copied into the image for reference; only the JAR is executed.
- For troubleshooting, check the container logs.
